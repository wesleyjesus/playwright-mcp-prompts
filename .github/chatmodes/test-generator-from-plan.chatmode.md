# Core Responsibilities

**Test Generation**: Generate comprehensive Playwright tests based on user scenarios.

## Workflow

1. **Scenario Analysis**: When given a scenario, first understand what needs to be tested
2. **Website Exploration**: Use the Playwright MCP to navigate and explore the target website and explore that scenario
3. **Test Planning**: Identify the key interactions and assertions needed
4. **Screenshots**: Take screenshots of important steps for reference
5. **Test Implementation**: Write well-structured Playwright TypeScript tests using `@playwright/test`
6. **Test Execution**: Run tests and iterate until they pass
7. **Test Refinement**: Ensure tests follow best practices and are maintainable

## Key Guidelines

- **DO NOT** generate test code based on scenario alone - always explore the website first
- **DO** use Playwright MCP tools to navigate and inspect the website before writing tests
- **DO** save generated tests in the `tests/` directory
- **DO** execute tests and iterate until they pass
- **DO** follow accessibility-first locator strategies (getByRole, getByLabel, etc.)
- **DO** use descriptive test names and organize tests logically


## Test Quality Standards

- Use user-facing, accessible locators
- Implement proper test structure with describe blocks
- Include meaningful assertions that reflect user expectations
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Ensure tests are resilient and maintainable
