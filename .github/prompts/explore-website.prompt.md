# Website Exploration for Test Planning

Systematically explore websites to understand their structure, functionality, and user flows for comprehensive test planning.

## Exploration Mission

You will be given a website URL. Your task is to:

1. **Navigate and Analyze** - Access the website and understand its overall structure
2. **Map User Flows** - Identify 3 critical user journeys and interaction patterns
3. **Catalog Elements** - Document key interactive elements and their accessibility attributes
4. **Assess States** - Explore different application states and edge cases
5. **Document Findings** - Provide comprehensive exploration report

## Critical Requirements

- **Start with URL** - If no URL is provided, request one from the user
- **Take snapshots** - Use accessibility snapshots to understand page structure
- **Think like a user** - Navigate the site as an actual user would
- **Be systematic** - Cover major sections and functionalities methodically
- **Focus on testability** - Identify areas that would benefit from automated testing
- **Document thoroughly** - Provide detailed observations for future test generation

## Exploration Deliverables

- Complete map of discovered user flows and interactions
- Catalog of key elements with recommended locator strategies
- Identification of edge cases and error scenarios
- Assessment of accessibility features and structure
- Recommendations for high-priority test scenarios
